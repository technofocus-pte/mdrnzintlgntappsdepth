# **Lab 2: Create a canvas app from an image and add Copilot control (Preview)**

**Estimated duration**: 20 min

## **Objective**: ##
In this lab, you will learn how to create an app from a
visual design and connect it to data through a few simple, guided steps.
You will learn to customize the app and learn how to add a Copilot
control to a canvas app.    

**Note:** Copilot in Power Apps can generate different app layouts,
forms, and data connections apps.

## **Exercise 1: Create a canvas app from an image**

### **Task 1: Create an app**

1.  Sign in with your Office 365 tenant credentials to Power Apps using
    <https://make.powerapps.com/>.

2.  Ensure that you are in **Dev** **One** environment.

> ![](./media/image1.png)

3.  Select **+ Create** from the left-pane and then select **Start with
    a page design**.

> ![](./media/image2.png)

4.  Select **Image** **or Figma file**.

> ![](./media/image3.png)

5.  Ensure that **Start from an image** is selected. Review the examples
    of recommended images and tips. Once you’re done, select
    the **Next** button.

6.  Enter a name for the app – **Membership Form**. Select **Start with
    sample image**. Select **Membership form image**. Select **Phone**
    format and then select **Next**.

> ![](./media/image5.png)
>
> **Note:** If you're using your own image, the image file extension
> must be .jpg or .png, and the file size must be less than 4MB. Also,
> the image must contain a clearly legible one-page form with a light
> background color. For the best results, edit your image so that it has
> a white background and high contrast.

7.  Your image will be automatically tagged based on the components that
    were identified. For example, in the following sample image, the box
    that says “Enter your first name” was identified as a **Text
    input** control. After you've reviewed the tags and ensured that
    each component is correctly tagged, select **Next**.

> **Note:** You can draw a new tag by selecting and dragging to select
> the region that encompasses the component. Then, choose the type of
> component that you want to associate the new tag with.
>
> To make edits to an existing tag or to delete it, select the tag. You
> can then assign a different component for that tag, or adjust the
> dimensions of the tag by dragging the corners to change the size. If
> you'd like to remove the tag, select **Delete tag**.
>
> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

>
> **Tip:** Select the **Guidance** tab on the right-side of the screen
> to learn more about the different types of components and how to
> accurately tag each one.

8.  The next step is to set up data. For the best experience,
    select ***Connect to a Dataverse table*** and select **Next**.
    You'll be guided in the next stage to either select an existing
    Dataverse table you have and map the fields in the image to the
    columns in that table or create a new table in Dataverse and add
    columns based on the form fields in your image, and your app will
    contain a form component that is connected to your Dataverse table.

> **Note:** The option to Connect to a Dataverse table will be disabled
> if you don't have Dataverse in your environment. If you don't want to
> connect to Dataverse, select **Skip this for now**. If you choose this
> option and select **Create**, your app will be created as-is, which
> means that the components you tagged in the previous step will be
> generated directly. They won't be placed into a form component, and
> your app won't be connected to data.
>
> ![](./media/image7.png)

9.  From the drop-down menu of the **Table name** field, choose **Create
    new table** and then select **Next**.

> ![](./media/image8.png)
>
> **Note:** Each tag corresponds to a data column based on the form
> fields that were identified in your image. You can edit the table and
> column details. Select a tag to modify the column properties, such
> as **Display Name**, **Name**, and **Data type**. To remove an
> existing column, select the tag and then select **Delete column**.

10. Select **Next**, you'll be able to review the table and column
    structure.

> **Note:** Select **Table properties** on the right-side of the screen
> to view and edit the properties for your new table.
>
> ![](./media/image10.png)

11. Once you've completed the review, select **Create app** to create
    the app.

> ![](./media/image11.png)
>
> **Note:** The app creation might take few minutes.

12. Once the app is created, your new app will open in Power Apps Studio
    so you can continue building and customizing your app.

13. As you have chosen to create a new table in Dataverse, your form
    will be automatically connected to your new table. To check that,
    click on the **Form1** under the **Tree view** and observe that
    under the **Properties** pane, **Membership Form** is selected as a
    **Data source**.

**Summary**: In this lab, you learnt how to create a canvas app from an
image, how it gets connected to your data stored in the Dataverse and
how to customize the app. You also learnt how to add Copilot control to
a canvas app which lets app users get insights about the data in your
app through natural language conversations with an AI-powered copilot.
