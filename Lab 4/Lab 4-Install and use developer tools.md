7.  You'll see a list of system plug-ins. If you have custom plug-ins in
    your environment you would see them in the list as well. The
    (Assembly) are .NET DLLs that implement the plug-ins.

> **Note:** You need to expand the section to see the complete list.

9.  Each of the child items is implemented in the assembly. Expand one
    of the items to see the step registrations for that individual
    plug-in.

10. Step registration connects the plug-in as an event handler to the
    event. In the above example, this is handling a create on the
    insightsstorevirtualentity table.

11. Double-click on any step to see the step configuration details
    including what message and entity, it's registered on, the pipeline
    stage when the plugin will be invoked, whether execution is
    synchronous or asynchronous, etc.

**Summary:** In this lab, you have learnt how to install developer
tools. When you create your own custom plug-in, you will use Plugin
Registration Tool to load the assembly and register the steps for the
events that you want to handle.
